<h1>All the colors of the rainbow</h1>

This little app that could will generate a palette of colors for you, based off an image that you upload.

Currently only supports jpg and png.

Simply upload an image, choose the number of colors you would like and hit 'get palette'.

I will be working on the apps sizing and mobile reactivity in the near future but if you have any code to contribute please feel free to make that pull request.

I hope you enjoy this project as much as I am.
